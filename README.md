# pacman
libsfml c++ implementation of pacman

builds on ubuntu.  here's a list of potentially overlapping but necessary dependencies:

`$ sudo apt install libsfml-dev cmake build-essential`

for good measure do autoconf and libtool because building C and C++ projects on linux often requires them:

`$ sudo apt install libtool autoconf`

install VSCode extensisons for CMake and C++ (TODO: add links)

in VSCode, ctrl+shift+p; then find CMake build commands (TODO: polish this instruction)

TODO: provide command line invocation of g++ with compiler and linker options so using CMake extension isn't required
